# Tableau Basic Projects Repository

Welcome to the Tableau Basic Projects repository! This collection features a series of beginner-level projects I created while learning Tableau. These projects demonstrate fundamental Tableau skills and visualization techniques, providing a solid foundation for anyone new to data visualization. Explore various aspects of Tableau through these projects, including:

1. **Data Connection**: Connecting to different data sources such as Excel, CSV, and SQL databases.
2. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and transforming data within Tableau.
3. **Basic Visualizations**: Creating bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots.
4. **Dashboards**: Designing interactive dashboards that combine multiple visualizations.
5. **Filters and Parameters**: Implementing filters and parameters to create dynamic and customizable visualizations.
6. **Calculated Fields**: Using calculated fields to derive new insights from data.
7. **Interactive Features**: Adding interactivity with actions, tooltips, and drill-down capabilities.
8. **Geographical Maps**: Visualizing data on geographical maps to identify regional trends.
9. **Storytelling**: Creating stories to present data in a narrative format.
10. **Formatting and Design**: Enhancing the appearance of visualizations with effective formatting and design principles.

Each project in this repository is designed to help you understand the basics of Tableau and develop the skills needed to create compelling data visualizations. Whether you are just starting your journey with Tableau or looking to refresh your skills, this repository provides practical examples and exercises to guide your learning.
